### [Live site](https://qienzgao.github.io/Master-of-Potions/)

## Overview
Master of Potions (MOP) is a webpage application game where players can interact with variant ingredients and process them with tools to make potions. Players are able to select the preferable ingredient and interact with it by hovering the cursor or clicking. After selecting the ingredient, the player can choose one of the tools to process the ingredient and generate a processed material. If satisfied with it, the player can extract it and it will be stored in the pot. Players may at any time hit "brew" to generate a potion. If processed materials in the pot match one of the formulas, a potion will be created accordingly.
